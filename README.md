# Qudit State Geometry Visualization
**Interactive tools for visualizing the geometric mapping of algebraic representations of qudits**.
The repository contains the computational tools developed during summer 2025 research in quantum phyiscs supervised under Paul Cadden-Zimansky at Bard College. The focus was on creating 2D, 3D interactive visualizations to understand the geometry of qutrit, 2-qubit probability simplicies. 

**Associated Reserch:** This work will be presented at the **American Physical Society (APS) March Meeting 2026**, and the research paper is currently being prepared to be published at the *American Journal of Physics*.
